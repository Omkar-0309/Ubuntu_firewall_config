# Nmap Scan Report

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the results from an Nmap scan performed on the IP address `10.0.2.15`. The scan was conducted using Nmap version 7.95 with the `-v -A` flags to enable verbose output and aggressive scanning.

## Scan Details

**Date and Time of Scan**: 2024-07-20 19:49 India Standard Time  
**Nmap Version**: 7.95  
**Flags Used**: `-v` (verbose), `-A` (aggressive)

## Scan Summary

- **Host Status**: Host is up (0.022s latency).
- **Ports**: All 1000 scanned ports are in ignored states.
- **Nmap Warning**: OSScan results may be unreliable because we could not find at least 1 open and 1 closed port.

## Detailed Results

### 1. **Port Scan**

All 1000 scanned ports on `10.0.2.15` are in ignored states. The ports are reported as filtered, meaning that Nmap did not receive a response from these ports. This could indicate that the ports are being filtered by a firewall or similar security device.

### 2. **OS Detection**

- **Device Type**: The target could be a power-device, firewall, wireless access point (WAP), router, print server, or general-purpose device.
- **Aggressive OS Guesses**:
  - APC Network Management Card 3 (96%)
  - Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA 9.2) (96%)
  - Cisco Aironet 3800-series WAP (96%)
  - Synology RT1900ac router (96%)
  - HP 2101nw wireless print server (93%)
  - D-Link DI-524 wireless broadband router (89%)
  - Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4 (87%)
  - Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2 (87%)

- **OS CPE (Common Platform Enumeration)**:
  - `cpe:/o:cisco:asa:9.2`
  - `cpe:/h:synology:rt1900ac`
  - `cpe:/h:hp:2101nw`
  - `cpe:/h:dlink:di-524`
  - `cpe:/o:microsoft:windows_2000::sp4`
  - `cpe:/o:microsoft:windows_server_2003::sp2`

**Note**: No exact OS matches were found. The detection conditions were not ideal, which may affect the accuracy of the OS detection.

### 3. **Traceroute**

Traceroute was performed to determine the path packets took from the scanning machine to the target:

```
HOP RTT       ADDRESS
1   4.00 ms   192.168.247.193
2   217.00 ms 192.168.29.10
3   19.00 ms  192.168.28.137
4   17.00 ms  192.168.31.20
5   19.00 ms  10.0.2.15
```

The traceroute indicates that packets traveled through 5 hops before reaching the target. The latency between hops varies, with the final hop to `10.0.2.15` being relatively quick.

## Conclusion

The scan results indicate that all scanned ports are filtered and do not provide a clear view of open or closed ports. The OS detection results are inconclusive, and the target device could be one of several possibilities based on the aggressive OS guesses.

For more accurate results, consider performing additional scans with different options or configurations, or examine the network and firewall settings of the target device.
